    <h1>React on Firebase Project Template</h1>

    <p>
        This template demonstrates using React with Firebase Hosting, Auth, and Database.
        It is based on a combination of the <a href="http://localhost:3000/templates/client-side-react/public/">Client-Side React</a>
            and <a href="http://localhost:3000/templates/firebase/public/">Firebase</a> templates.
    </p>

    <p>
        See the <a href="https://github.com/odigity/academy/blob/master/docs/Firebase.md">Firebase</a>
            and <a href="https://github.com/odigity/academy/blob/master/docs/React.md">React</a> docs for more info.
    </p>

        You can see this app hosted on Firebase here: <a href="https://project-template-react.firebaseio.com/">https://project-template-react.firebaseio.com/</a>

    <h2>Template Structure Notes</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>database.rules.json</b> &mdash; This is a new file that you can use store
                the <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/security/database/">Firebase Database Rules</a> for your project.
            You also have to tell Firebase which file contains your database rules, which you can see specified in the "database" section of 'firebase.json'.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Rewrites</b> &mdash; We've also added a "rewrites" section to 'firebase.json' that tells the Firebase Hosting servers that
                all requests should be redirected to index.html.
            That way when if a user clicks on the 'About' link to go to '/about' URL, then hits refresh, the app will be reloaded instead of returning a 404 Not Found.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <div id="root"></div>   <!-- It is a good convention to create an empty <div> tag with id="root" to mount your React app rather than mounting directly on <body>. -->

    <!-- It is recommended to put <script> tags at the end of the <body>. -->

    <!-- Include index.js with type="text/babel" so Babel will transpile it before executing it.
