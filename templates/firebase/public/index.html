    <h1>Firebase Project Template</h1>

    <p>
        This template demonstrates using Firebase Hosting, and is based on the <a href="http://localhost:3000/templates/one-file-per-type/">One-File-Per-Type</a> template.
        (To see Firebase Auth and Database examples, check out the <a href="http://localhost:3000/templates/react-on-firebase/public/">React on Firebase</a> template.)
    </p>

    <p>
        Note: This example uses odigity's Firebase Project ID for deployment and hosting, which you don't have access to.
        In order to try deploying it yourself, first create your own Firebase Project, then substitute your own Project ID in '.firebaserc'.
        See the <a href="https://github.com/odigity/academy/blob/master/docs/Firebase.md">Firebase doc</a> for more info.
    </p>

    <h2>Template Structure Notes</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>public/ Folder</b> &mdash; Notice our app files have now been moved into a 'public/' subdirectory.
            This is a better convention than putting your content directly in the project root.
            It also works with Firebase's convention of specifying the location of your public folder in 'firebase.json'.
            That folder will be served at the root of the hosted website, so 'public/index.html' will be served at
                <a href="https://project-template-hosting.firebaseapp.com/">https://project-template-hosting.firebaseapp.com/</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>firebase.json</b> &mdash; This is a JSON file that specifies your project's settings for the various Firebase services.
            In this case, we're only using Firebase Hosting.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>.firebase.rc</b> &mdash; This is also a JSON file that mostly is just for specifying the Project ID of the default project to use when deploying.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <!-- It is recommended to put <script> tags at the end of the <body>. -->
    <script src="index.js"></script>    <!-- Include index.js as a JavaScript script file. -->
