## Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)

By far, the best resource on the web for learning standard web technologies is MDN.

* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/

Beginners should start with the Learn series:

* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript

After that, check out the Guides and Tutorials:

* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML (Tutorials)
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS (Tutorials)
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/  (Tutorials and Guide)

Lastly, the References are where you go to get exact answers to all questions:

* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference

## HTML & CSS

My favorite book for learning HTML & CSS is:

* [HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1118008189/) by Jon Duckett (2011-Nov-8, 490 pages)

[CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/) is a beautiful and historically significant website demonstrating the power of CSS by showing the same page styled hundreds of different ways.

It's far easier to work with HTML & CSS if you take some time to learn how to use your browser's Developer Tools:

* [Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools)
* [Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools)
