# Resources

## Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)

By far, the best resource on the web for learning standard web technologies is MDN.

* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/

Beginners should start with the Learn series:

* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript

After that, check out the Guides and Tutorials:

* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML (Tutorials)
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS (Tutorials)
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/  (Tutorials and Guide)

Lastly, the References are where you go to get exact answers to all questions:

* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model

## HTML & CSS

My favorite book for learning HTML & CSS is:

* [HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1118008189/) by Jon Duckett (2011-Nov-8, 490 pages)

[CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/) is a beautiful and historically significant website demonstrating the power of CSS by showing the same page styled hundreds of different ways.

It's far easier to work with HTML & CSS if you take some time to learn how to use your browser's Developer Tools:

* Chrome &mdash; https://developer.chrome.com/devtools
* Firefox &mdash; https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools

## JavaScript

Other than MDN, by far the two best resources for mastering JavaScript are [Douglas Crockford](http://www.crockford.com/) and [Kyle Simpson](https://github.com/getify).

### Douglas Crockford

In addition to inventing JSON and JSLint, he also wrote the most historically significant JavaScript book:

* [JavaScript: The Good Parts](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0596517742) (2008-May, 176 pages)

He also gave a famous series of lectures on JavaScript over the years to fellow employees at Yahoo:

* [Douglas Crockford Lectures on JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL62E185BB8577B63D)
    * [The JavaScript Programming Language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2ifWcnQs6M)
    * [An Inconvenient API - The Theory of the DOM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2Y0U-2qJMs) (2006-10-11)

    * [Scene 6: Loopage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47Ceot8yqeI)
    * [Level 7: ECMAScript 5: The New Parts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTEqr0IlFKY) (2011)
    * [Section 8: Programming Style & Your Brain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taaEzHI9xyY) (YUIConf 2011 Keynote)

### Kyle Simpson

Kyle has written an amazing six-book series called [You Don't Know JS](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AY9P0P6).
Amazon offers them bundled (for a discount, I think) or separately, but if you want to save money, there's a less pretty version available to read for free here: https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS
