# Create React App

Below is a log from my console session when creating the create-react-app project template.

    odigity@desktop:~//src/academy/templates/create-react-app$ npm run build

    > create-react-app@0.1.0 build /home/odigity/src/academy/templates/create-react-app
    > react-scripts build

    Creating an optimized production build...
    Compiled successfully.

    File sizes after gzip:

      45.91 KB  build/static/js/main.61ab9133.js
      289 B     build/static/css/main.9a0fe4f1.css

    The project was built assuming it is hosted at the server root.
    To override this, specify the homepage in your package.json.
    For example, add this to build it for GitHub Pages:

      "homepage": "http://myname.github.io/myapp",

    The build folder is ready to be deployed.
    You may also serve it locally with a static server:

      npm install -g pushstate-server
      pushstate-server build
      open http://localhost:9000
